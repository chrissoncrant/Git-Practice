                    <p>This is merely a page that is being set up to practice my Git and GitHub interactions.</p>
                    <p>I am so new to all this, but I find it to be so fun!</p> 
                    <p>Now, it does get confusing at times.</p> 
                    <p>Okay. A LOT of the time.</p> 
                    <p>But I am learning that that is quite alright.</p> 
                    <p>In fact it's better than alright!</p>
                    <p>It is awesome!</p> <p>Why?</p> 
                    <p>Well it's because the more I am confused the better I become at being confused.</p>
                    <p>What the heck does that mean?</p>
                    <p>It means I get better at knowing how to get unconfused.</p>
                    <p>And I'll be damned if that ain't one of the most important skills in life itself</p>
